                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>Sweet Crumbs began in a small kitchen in 2012, born from a grandmother's handwritten recipe book and a family's unshakeable belief that food made with love tastes different. What started as weekend baking for neighbors slowly grew into something none of us expected — a beloved community bakery that now serves hundreds of happy customers every single day. Every loaf, tart, and croissant that leaves our kitchen carries that same original spirit: honest ingredients, traditional techniques, and a whole lot of heart.</p>
